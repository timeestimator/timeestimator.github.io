# Time Estimator

Web app to estimate the duration of compound tasks by breaking the task down into sub-tasks and possible surprise events.

## Status: 

* Basic interface implemented based on simple html templating

## TODO List

The following list of todo is incomplete and also just a few ideas of useful features.

* Real-time update of the visualization as values are changed
* Use of [tangle](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/) instead of text boxes so that values can be changed by hovering over a value and dragging to the side to increase or decrease values
* Use of browser storage to store the data entered so that one can come back to a previous estimation
* Storing and reading out of entered values in URL parameters so that a complete estimation can be stored in the URL (and thus be shared by link or stored as a bookmark)
